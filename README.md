## Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

### Lab07 - Handle Local Server Requests

#### Task 01 - Set Up Server Repository

Estimate of time needed to complete: 20m

Start time: 3:05PM

Finish time: 3:13PM

Actual time needed to complete: 8m

#### Task 02 - Weather

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 3:14PM

Finish time: 4:51PM

Actual time needed to complete: 96m

* Took a small snack break around 4:00, lasted about 10-15m? So ~80m if not including that 

#### Task 03 - Errors

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 4:53

Finish time: 6:22

Actual time needed to complete: 89m

* Spent like 45m-60m helping Sheldon with his Task02 before finishing my Task 03 so probably only took about 15-30m total

### Lab08 - Handle Proxy Requests to 3rd Party APIs

#### Task 01 - Weatherbit API

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 3:50PM

Finish time: 5:38PM

Actual time needed to complete: 108m

#### Task 02 - The MovieDB API

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 5:45PM

Finish time: 6:47PM

Actual time needed to complete: 62m

#### Task 03 - Publish/Deploy Server

Estimate of time needed to complete: 10m

Start time: 6:50PM

Finish time: 7:05PM

Actual time needed to complete: 15m

* I followed along during Jacob's demonstration earlier today so this didn't take as long to set up. My weatherbit API calls are still working but my movies api call only works when the server is run locally - gonna have to ask about that tomorrow in class.
