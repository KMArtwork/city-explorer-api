### Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

#### Task 01 - Set Up Server Repository

Estimate of time needed to complete: 20m

Start time: 3:05PM

Finish time: 3:13PM

Actual time needed to complete: 8m

#### Task 02 - Weather

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 3:14PM

Finish time: 4:51PM

Actual time needed to complete: 96m

* Took a small snack break around 4:00, lasted about 10-15m? So ~80m if not including that 

#### Task 03 - Errors

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 4:53

Finish time: 6:22

Actual time needed to complete: 89m

* Spent like 45m-60m helping Sheldon with his Task02 before finishing my Task 03 so probably only took about 15-30m total
